# CatATM

This is the README for the CatATM!

This program is for the Code Louisville Capstone Project for Jan 2022 cohort.
I have created this program with the idea in mind to create a simple ATM teller program,
but with the behavior of a cat!


Project requirements for what I am targeting:

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent

Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)

---------------------------------------------
Notes and instructions: 
I have created several test accounts before logging in:

User Account 1: 123456
Pin Number: 1234

User Account 2: 246810
Pin Number: 1357

*User Account 3: 135790
Pin Number: 2468

*For demonstration purposes: if you log in as User Account 3, 
*the program will give you a lock out error message*

-------------------------------------------------------
After logging in successfully you are given several choices:

Pet the cat, feed the cat, play with the cat, or log out of the program.

To choose, your commands to type in are:

Pet cat
Feed cat
Play cat
Log out
