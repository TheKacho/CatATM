# CatATM

This is the README for the CatATM!

This program is for the Code Louisville Capstone Project for Jan 2022 cohort.
I have created this program with the idea in mind to create a ATM teller simulation,
but with the behavior of a cat!

Note: 
I have created several test accounts before logging in:

User Account 1: 123456
Pin Number: 1234

User Account 2: 246810
Pin Number: 1357

*User Account 3: 135790
Pin Number: 2468

*For demonstration purposes: if you log in as User Account 3, 
*the program will give you a lock out error message*


After logging in successfully you are given several choices:

Pet the cat, feed the cat, play with the cat, or log out of the program.


To choose, your commands to type in are:

Pet cat
Feed cat
Play cat
Log out
